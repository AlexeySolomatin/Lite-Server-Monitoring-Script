**Lite Server Monitor (LSM)** is an open-source project designed to monitor Linux servers without requiring Docker, databases, web interfaces, or heavy monitoring platforms.

The project focuses on simplicity, low resource usage, and reliable unattended operation.

Once installed, LSM continuously monitors your server, sends notifications when issues occur, and generates a daily health report.

# Why Lite Server Monitor?

Unlike enterprise monitoring platforms, Lite Server Monitor does **not** require:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Redis
- Web UI
- Monitoring agents
- Complex initial configuration

The project follows a simple philosophy:

> **Install → Configure → Forget.**

After installation, everything runs automatically using **systemd timers**.

---

# Perfect For

Lite Server Monitor is ideal for:

- Home servers
- NAS devices
- Print servers
- Video surveillance servers
- Virtual machines
- Small office servers
- Dedicated Linux servers

---

# What This Project Is NOT

Lite Server Monitor is **not** intended to replace:

- Zabbix
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Netdata

It is designed for reliable monitoring of one or several Linux servers without deploying a complete enterprise monitoring infrastructure.

---

# Supported Operating Systems

Currently supported:

- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Debian 12

Additional distributions may be supported in future releases.

---

# Architecture

Lite Server Monitor is built using a modular architecture.

Each module performs a single task and can be installed or removed independently.

Core components include:

- `lsm` command-line interface
- Modular installer
- Shared library
- Independent monitoring modules
- Unified notification system
- systemd services and timers

---

# Modules

## Monitoring

- Disk Monitor
- SMART Monitor
- RAID Monitor
- System Monitor
- Temperature Monitor
- UPS Monitor
- Daily Health Report

## Security
