# Why Lite Server Monitor?

Unlike enterprise monitoring platforms, Lite Server Monitor does **not** require:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Redis
- Web UI
- Monitoring agents
- Complex initial configuration

The project follows a simple philosophy:

> **Install → Configure → Forget.**

After installation, everything runs automatically using **systemd timers**.

---

# Perfect For

Lite Server Monitor is ideal for:

- Home servers
- NAS devices
- Print servers
- Video surveillance servers
- Virtual machines
- Small office servers
- Dedicated Linux servers

---

# What This Project Is NOT

Lite Server Monitor is **not** intended to replace:

- Zabbix
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Netdata

It is designed for reliable monitoring of one or several Linux servers without deploying a complete enterprise monitoring infrastructure.

---

# Supported Operating Systems

Currently supported:

- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Debian 12

Additional distributions may be supported in future releases.

---

# Architecture

Lite Server Monitor is built using a modular architecture.

Each module performs a single task and can be installed or removed independently.

Core components include:

- `lsm` command-line interface
- Modular installer
- Shared library
- Independent monitoring modules
- Unified notification system
- systemd services and timers

---

# Modules

## Monitoring

- Disk Monitor
- SMART Monitor
- RAID Monitor
- System Monitor
- Temperature Monitor
- UPS Monitor
- Daily Health Report

## Security
